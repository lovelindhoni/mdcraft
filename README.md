## Usage

MdCraft was primarily created for my personal use, but you can use it for anything:

- Taking quick notes while watching programming tutorials online.
- Creating and organizing Markdown-based documentation.
- Collaborative Markdown editing and previewing.

In addition to these use cases, MdCraft comes pre-loaded with some useful reference notes on, mostly to make the app to look busy:

- Python programming basics.
- TypeScript language fundamentals.
- SQL database concepts.

Feel free to explore and delete these pre-created notes or create your own!
